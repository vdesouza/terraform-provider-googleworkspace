# googleworkspace_chrome_policy_group_priority_ordering (Resource)

Chrome Policy Group Priority Ordering resource in the Terraform Googleworkspace provider. This resource manages the priority ordering of groups for a specific Chrome policy. Groups with higher priority (earlier in the list) override policies from groups with lower priority.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1: Group priority ordering for chrome.users.* policies
# (does not require policy_target_key)

resource "googleworkspace_group" "high_priority" {
  email = "high-priority@example.com"
  name  = "High Priority Group"
}

resource "googleworkspace_group" "medium_priority" {
  email = "medium-priority@example.com"
  name  = "Medium Priority Group"
}

resource "googleworkspace_group" "low_priority" {
  email = "low-priority@example.com"
  name  = "Low Priority Group"
}

# For chrome.users.* policies, policy_target_key is not required
resource "googleworkspace_chrome_policy_group_priority_ordering" "wallpaper" {
  policy_schema = "chrome.users.Wallpaper"

  # Groups in priority order (highest to lowest)
  # Policies from high-priority group will override those from medium and low priority groups
  group_ids = [
    googleworkspace_group.high_priority.id,
    googleworkspace_group.medium_priority.id,
    googleworkspace_group.low_priority.id,
  ]
}

# Example 2: Group priority ordering for chrome.apps.* policies
# (requires policy_target_key with target app)

resource "googleworkspace_org_unit" "sales" {
  name                 = "Sales"
  parent_org_unit_path = "/"
}

resource "googleworkspace_chrome_policy_group_priority_ordering" "app_specific" {
  policy_schema = "chrome.apps.ExampleAppPolicy"

  # For chrome.apps.* policies, policy_target_key is required
  policy_target_key {
    target_resource = googleworkspace_org_unit.sales.id

    # The target app must be supplied in additional_target_key_names
    additional_target_key_names = {
      app_id = "chrome:example_app_id"
    }
  }

  # Groups in priority order (highest to lowest)
  group_ids = [
    googleworkspace_group.high_priority.id,
    googleworkspace_group.medium_priority.id,
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `group_ids` (List of String) Ordered list of group IDs. Groups earlier in the list have higher priority and their policies will override those of groups later in the list.
- `policy_schema` (String) The full qualified name of the policy schema.

### Optional

- `policy_namespace` (String) The namespace of the policy type for the request.
- `policy_target_key` The target resource for which the group priority ordering applies. Required only for chrome.apps.* policies. Not needed for chrome.users.* and other policy types. When provided, the target app must be supplied in additional_target_key_names. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--policy_target_key))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--policy_target_key"></a>
### Nested Schema for `policy_target_key`

Required:

- `additional_target_key_names` (Map of String) Map of additional target keys. The target app must be supplied here.
- `target_resource` (String) The target resource on which this policy is applied (e.g., 'orgunits/123').
